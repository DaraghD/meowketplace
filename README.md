# meowketplace - CS4116 Software Development Project
A business marketplace website with a focus on pets
# Development
**main** branch is protected as the plan is to have it be used to deploy the site through github actions, make your changes on a different branch then submit a pull request to merge to main.
- Backend - Java Springboot 
- Frontend - React
- Database - MySQL/MariaDB

To easily run the database install docker compose and run `docker-compose up` in the root directory to start the database.  
Springboot is set to use the config in the 'docker-compose.yml' file to connect to the database.
